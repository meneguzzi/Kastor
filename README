Kastor is an implementation of an AgentSpeak interpreter extended with plan 
patterns for the creation of distributed plans following the technique from 
the paper Interaction among agents that plan. In Kastor, a developer can 
define external plans for each agent through the EP plan pattern, which 
creates a communication endpoint in the sharing agent allowing other agents 
in the society to request this plan to be executed on their behalf.
